<h2 id="einleitung-ueberblick-en" class="adsimple-111791882">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have written this privacy policy (version 21.09.2021-311833614) in order to explain to you, in accordance with the provisions of the <a class="adsimple-111791882" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp%3Btid=%5Badsimpletextid]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the controller – and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) – process, will process in the future and what legal options you have. The terms used are to be considered as gender-neutral.<br />
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">In short:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about any personal data we process about you.</p>
<p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. So long as it aids transparency, technical <strong class="adsimple-111791882">terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links</strong> to further information are provided and <strong class="adsimple-111791882">graphics</strong> are used. We are thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible with brief, unclear and legal-technical statements, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you have not been familiar with.<br />
If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint, to follow the existing links and to look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.</p>
<h2 id="anwendungsbereich-en" class="adsimple-111791882">Scope</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). With the term personal data, we refer to information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111791882">
<li class="adsimple-111791882">all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">Social media presences and email communication</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner by the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="rechtsgrundlagen-en" class="adsimple-111791882">Legal bases</h2>
<p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br />
Whenever EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a class="adsimple-111791882" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&tid=111791882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>
<p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ol>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of data you entered into a contact form.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">Contract</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for our bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically. Therefore, the processing is a legitimate interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other conditions such as making recordings in the interest of the public, the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. Should such a legal basis be relevant, it will be disclosed in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111791882">
<li class="adsimple-111791882">In <strong class="adsimple-111791882">Austria</strong> this is the Austrian Data Protection Act (<strong class="adsimple-111791882">Datenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong class="adsimple-111791882">DSG</strong>.</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">In <strong class="adsimple-111791882">Germany</strong> this is the Federal Data Protection Act (<strong class="adsimple-111791882">Bundesdatenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong class="adsimple-111791882">BDSG</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>

<h2 id="speicherdauer-en" class="adsimple-111791882">Storage Period</h2>
<p>It is a general criterion for us to store personal data only for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as any reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to keep certain data stored even after the original purpose no longer exists, such as for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>If you want your data to be deleted or if you want to revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no obligation to continue its storage.</p>
<p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.</p>
<h2 id="rechte-dsgvo-en" class="adsimple-111791882">Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>

<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">What is web hosting?</h3>
<p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information – including personal data – is automatically created and stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as possible, and only with good reason. By website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e. everything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here). By domain we mean example.uk or examplepage.com.</p>
<p>When you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know the names of some web browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p>
<p>The web browser has to connect to another computer which stores the website’s code: the web server. Operating a web server is complicated and time-consuming, which is why this is usually done by professional providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure the reliable and flawless storage of website data.</p>
<p>Whenever the browser on your computer establishes a connection (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and whenever data is being transferred to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. After all, your computer stores data, and the web server also has to retain the data for a period of time in order to ensure it can operate properly.</p>
<p>Illustration:</p>

<img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/browser-und-webserver.svg" alt="Browser and web server" width="100% " />
</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Why do we process personal data?</h3>
<p>The purposes of data processing are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">Professional hosting of the website and operational security</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">To maintain the operational as well as IT security</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">Anonymous evaluation of access patterns to improve our offer, and if necessary, for prosecution or the pursuit of claims.li></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Which data are processed?</h3>
<p>Even while you are visiting our website, our web server, that is the computer on which this website is saved, usually automatically saves data such as</p>
<ul class="adsimple-111791882">
<li class="adsimple-111791882">the full address (URL) of the accessed website (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/examplesubpage.html?tid=111791882)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/icamefromhere.html/)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">the host name and the IP address of the device from the website is being accessed from (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">date and time</li>
<li class="adsimple-111791882">in so-called web server log files</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">How long is the data stored?</h3>
<p>Generally, the data mentioned above are stored for two weeks and are then automatically deleted. We do not pass these data on to others, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this data may be viewed by the authorities in the event of illegal conduct.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-111791882">In short:</strong> Your visit is logged by our provider (company that runs our website on special computers (servers)), but we do not pass on your data without your consent!</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Legal basis</h3>
<p>The lawfulness of processing personal data in the context of web hosting is justified in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (safeguarding of legitimate interests), as the use of professional hosting with a provider is necessary to present the company in a safe and user-friendly manner on the internet, as well as to have the ability to track any attacks and claims, if necessary.</p>

<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">What is Web Analytics?</h3>
<p>We use software on our website, which is known as web analytics, in order to evaluate website visitor behaviour. Thus, data is collected, which the analytic tool provider (also called tracking tool) stores, manages and processes. Analyses of user behaviour on our website are created with this data, which we as the website operator receive. Most tools also offer various testing options. These enable us, to for example test which offers or content our visitors prefer. For this, we may show you two different offers for a limited period of time. After the test (a so-called A/B test) we know which product or content our website visitors find more interesting. For such testing as well as for various other analyses, user profiles are created and the respective data is stored in cookies.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Why do we run Web Analytics?</h3>
<p>We have a clear goal in mind when it comes to our website: we want to offer our industry’s best website on the market. Therefore, we want to give you both, the best and most interesting offer as well as comfort when you visit our website. With web analysis tools, we can observe the behaviour of our website visitors, and then improve our website accordingly for you and for us. For example, we can see the average age of our visitors, where they come from, the times our website gets visited the most, and which content or products are particularly popular. All this information helps us to optimise our website and adapt it to your needs, interests and wishes.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Which data are processed?</h3>
<p>The exact data that is stored depends on the analysis tools that are being used. But generally, data such as the content you view on our website are stored, as well as e. g. which buttons or links you click, when you open a page, which browser you use, which device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you visit the website with, or which computer system you use. If you have agreed that location data may also be collected, this data may also be processed by the provider of the web analysis tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, your IP address is also stored. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), IP addresses are personal data. However, your IP address is usually stored in a pseudonymised form (i.e. in an unrecognisable and abbreviated form). No directly linkable data such as your name, age, address or email address are stored for testing purposes, web analyses and web optimisations. If this data is collected, it is retained in a pseudonymised form. Therefore, it cannot be used to identify you as a person.</p>
<p>The following example shows Google Analytics’ functionality as an example for client-based web tracking with JavaScript code.</p>
<p>
<img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/google-analytics-dataflow.svg" alt="Schematic data flow in Google Analytics" width="100%" />
</p>
<p>The storage period of the respective data always depends on the provider. Some cookies only retain data for a few minutes or until you leave the website, while other cookies can store data for several years.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">

</h3>
<p>If we have any further information on the duration of data processing, you will find it below. We generally only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide products and services. The storage period may be extended if it is required by law, such as for accounting purposes for example for accounting.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Right to object</h3>
<p>You also have the option and the right to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data processing by cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Legal basis</h3>
<p>The use of Web Analytics requires your consent, which we obtained with our cookie popup. According to <strong class="adsimple-111791882">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR (consent)</strong>, this consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, such as by collection through Web Analytics tools.</p>
<p>In addition to consent, we have a legitimate interest in analysing the behaviour of website visitors, which enables us to technically and economically improve our offer. With Web Analytics, we can recognise website errors, identify attacks and improve profitability. The legal basis for this is <strong class="adsimple-111791882">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use these tools if you have given your consent.</p>
<p>Since Web Analytics tools use cookies, we recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies. If you want to find out which of your data are stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p>

<p>In order to be able to deliver all the individual sub-pages of our website to you quickly and securely on all devices, we use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) BootstrapCDN of the American software company StackPath, LLC 2012 McKinney Ave. Suite 1100, Dallas, TX 75201, USA. A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the Internet. Through this network, content – especially very large files, can be delivered quickly, even with large peak loads.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Why do we use BootstrapCDN?</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that we want to offer you a comprehensive and well-functioning service with our website. This also includes a fast website. With jsdelivr.com-CDN our website can load much faster for you. The use of jsdelivr.com-CDN is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since here the page can be delivered from a server nearby.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Which data is processed by BootstrapCDN?</h3>
<p>BootstrapCDN enables the delivery of JavaScript libraries to your browser. If your browser then downloads a file of the BootstrapCDN, your IP address is transmitted to the company StockPath during the connection with the Bootstrap CDN server. Personal data may also be transmitted and stored. BootstrapCDN can thus collect and store user data such as IP addresses, browser type, browser version, which website is loaded or the time and date of the page visit. In the Privacy Policy of BootstrapCDN’s or <a class="adsimple-111791882" href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsdelivr.com</a> it is expressly pointed out that the Company does not use cookies or other tracking services.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">How long and where will the data be stored?</h3>
<p>BootstrapCDN has its servers distributed in different countries and thus, your data may also be stored outside the European Economic Area. BootstrapCDN retains personal data that is processed on our behalf for as long as is necessary for the providing its services, fulfilling legal obligations, settling disputes and enforcing agreements.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Right to object</h3>
<p>You always have the right to information, rectification and erasure of your personal data. If you have any questions, you can always contact the responsible parties at BootstrapCDN.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent this data transfer, you can use a JavaScript blocker (see for example https://noscript.net/ ) or deactivate the execution of JavaScript code in your browser. Please note, however, that this means the website can then no longer offer its usual services (such as fast loading speed).</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Legal basis</h3>
<p>If you have consented to the use of BootstrapCDN, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to <strong>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a of the GDPR (consent)</strong> the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as it can occur when data is collected by BootstrapCDN.</p>
<p>We also have a legitimate interest in using BootstrapCDN to optimise our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests).</strong> Nevertheless, we only use BootstrapCDN if you have consented to it.</p>
<p>BootstrapCDN also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.</p>
<p>BootstrapCDN uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as basis for data processing by recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and especially in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR). These clauses oblige BootstrapCDN to comply with the EU‘s level of data protection when processing relevant data outside the EU. These clauses are based on an implementing order by the EU Commission. You can find the order and the clauses here: <a class="adsimple-111791882" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847</a></p>

<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
<p>On our website we use Google Fonts, by the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).</p>
<p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.</p>
<p>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a directory with over 800 fonts that Google provides its users free of charge.</p>
<p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
<p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Which data is saved by Google?</h3>
<p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google’s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for „Application Programming Interface“ and works as a software data intermediary.</p>
<p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts’ BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google’s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.</p>
<p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser’s screen resolution and name to Google’s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p>
<p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google’s aim is to fundamentally boost websites’ loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">How can I erase my data or prevent it being stored?</h3>
<p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google’s support at <a class="adsimple-111791882" href="https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=311833614">https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=311833614</a>. The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.</p>
<p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at <a class="adsimple-111791882" href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=311833614">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=311833614</a>. While Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention.<br />
It proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-111791882">Legal basis</h3>
<p>If you have consented to the use of Google Fonts, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to <strong>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (Consent)</strong> your consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when it is processed by Google Fonts.</p>
<p>We also have a legitimate interest in using Google Font to optimise our online service. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use Google Font if you have given your consent to it.</p>
<p>Google also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.</p>
<p>Google uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as basis for data processing by recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and especially in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR).
